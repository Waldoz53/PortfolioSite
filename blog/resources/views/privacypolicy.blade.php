        <p class='margin-top-30'>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online.

        <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the US to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
        <p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
        <p>Users can visit our site anonymously</p>
        <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
        <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
        <p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>
        <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
        <p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
        <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
